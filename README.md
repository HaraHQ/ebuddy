# Background

- I don't have redux background (because I came from Zustand base as state management that more easier rather redux that more complex), so I took times to learn it first
- I never setup monorepo before, so it take multiple times to recreate project so I can create clean code here

---

# Differences

- I add firebase workplace instead put on backend, so you don't have to run firebase emulators:start thing, just `yarn dev`
- I add some pages to make sure the login system is used
- I use jsonwebtoken module for JWT
- I add cache for firebase emulator (i dont know if it bring along with git or not, you can start login using rixki and its password 123456)

# How to start

You can use `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
